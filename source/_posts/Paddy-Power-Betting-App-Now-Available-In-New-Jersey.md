Paddy Power and FanDuel have jointly announced their merger, which is expected to be complete by the end of the year. The merger will create a new company, with Paddy Power's current chairman and CEO, Andy Ryan, to serve as CEO. He will be joined on the board by two FanDuel representatives.

The new company will be headquartered in New York City and will operate under the Paddy Power name. It is anticipated that the merger will result in cost savings of $70 million annually.

This is not the first time that Paddy Power and FanDuel have teamed up. In January of this year, they announced a partnership that would see them offer combined products in both the United States and Ireland. The merger is seen as an extension of that agreement.

Paddy Power is one of Europe's largest bookmakers, while FanDuel is the leading daily fantasy sports company in North America. The merger will create a company with a combined value of $1 billion.

Paddy Power Betfair has announced plans to launch a sportsbook in Pennsylvania. The new site is expected to launch in the coming months, in time for the start of the NFL season.
