Are you a Tampa Bay Rays fan looking for an edge on your bookie? Do you want to know how to handicap Tampa Bay Rays games like a pro? If so, then read on. In this article, we will discuss the ins and outs of handicapping Tampa Bay Rays games.

To start off with, make sure that you are aware of the Vegas odds for each game. This is important because it will help you to determine whether or not the Rays are actually undervalued or overvalued by the oddsmakers. In general, you want to look for situations where the Rays are undervalued by the Vegas odds.

Another thing to look at when handicapping Tampa Bay Rays games is their lineup. This is important because it can give you an idea of which pitchers they might have a good matchup against. For example, if the Rays are facing a left-handed pitcher, then you might want to look at betting on them, as they have a lot of left-handed batters in their lineup who can hit well against southpaws.

In addition to lineup considerations, you should also take into account team trends when handicapping Tampa Bay Rays games. For example, if the Rays have been struggling lately, then it might be wise to avoid betting on them until they start playing better. Conversely, if the Rays have been on a hot streak lately, then you might want to consider betting on them in order to capitalize on their momentum.

Finally, don’t forget about home field advantage when handicapping Tampa Bay Rays games. The Tropicana Field can be a tough place for opposing teams to play in, so this should be taken into account when making your bets.

#  Handicapping The Tampa Bay Rays: What You Need To Know 

The Tampa Bay Rays have had one of the more interesting offseasons in baseball. After a surprising 93-win season in 2018, the Rays made a few big moves in free agency.

Most notably, they signed Charlie Morton to a two-year contract. Morton is coming off a career year with the Astros, posting a 3.13 ERA and striking out 201 batters in 202 innings.

Tampa Bay also acquired outfielder Avisail Garcia from the White Sox and catcher Mike Zunino from the Mariners. Garcia hit .330 with 18 home runs and 68 RBIs last season, while Zunino slugged .451 with 25 home runs and 64 RBIs.

So, what should we expect from the Rays in 2019?

Well, it's hard to say definitively, but they should be pretty good. The addition of Morton gives them one of the best rotations in baseball, and the lineup is now much more potent with Garcia and Zunino added to it.

 Betting on Tampa Bay may not be as lucrative as betting on other teams like the Yankees or Astros, but they are definitely worth considering as a dark horse contender for the World Series this year.

#  How to Bet on the Tampa Bay Rays 

The Tampa Bay Rays were surprise contenders for the American League pennant in 2018, and they are expected to be among the top teams in the division once again this season. If you’re looking to place a wager on their games, here’s everything you need to know.

First, let’s take a look at the Rays odds to win the American League East. As of this writing, they are listed at +425 to take home the divisional title. That means that if you bet $100 on them, you would win $425 if they were to pull off the upset.

Their odds to win the World Series are even more intriguing. At +4000, they are not given much of a chance by most sportsbooks, but that could make them an excellent longshot bet.

Now let’s take a look at some individual players who could have a big impact on the team’s fortunes this season.

Charlie Morton is coming off a career year with the Houston Astros and he will be looked upon to anchor the Rays starting rotation. He is currently listed at +2000 to win the American League Cy Young Award.

Ji-Man Choi was one of the team’s most productive hitters down the stretch last season and he is expected to be a key contributor again in 2019. His current betting odds to win Most Valuable Player are +6600.

Finally, we’ll take a quick look at the team’s odds of winning the Divisional Series and/or World Series. As mentioned earlier, they are considered longshots in both cases, but that could make them an attractive option for bettors looking for value. The Divisional Series odds are currently +325 and the World Series odds are +4000.

#  How to Bet the Tampa Bay Rays: Expert Advice 

The Tampa Bay Rays have had a tumultuous offseason, to say the least. After trading away their stars, they’re now one of the worst teams in baseball. However, this could present an opportunity for savvy bettors who know how to take advantage of bad teams. In this article, we will give you some expert advice on how to bet the Tampa Bay Rays. 

The first thing you need to do is look at their odds and find an underdog bet that offers good value. For example, their odds to win the American League are currently 66/1, so there is potential for a large return if they manage to pull off a surprise victory. 

You should also look at matchups between the Rays and other teams. For example, the Rays are scheduled to play the Yankees in a four game series in April. The Yankees are clearly the better team, but the Rays may be able to take at least one game from them. If you place a bet on the Yankees winning all four games, you would be making a safe bet with little potential for profit. However, if you place a bet on the Rays winning one game, you could make a hefty profit if they manage to pull off an upset victory. 

Finally, be sure to keep an eye on the team’s lineup and injuries. The Rays are likely going to be one of the worst teams in baseball this year, but that doesn’t mean they can’t pull off an occasional upset victory.

If you’re looking to bet on the Rays this season, here are three simple tips that will help you make money:

1. Bet on them when they’re playing at home

The Rays are one of the best teams in baseball when they play at home. They have a record of 34-17 at Tropicana Field so far this season, which is the best in baseball. They’re also 11-2 in their last 13 games at home, so it’s a good time to bet on them.

2. Bet on them when they’re playing against a weak opponent

The Rays are also very good when they play against weak opponents. They have a record of 25-7 against teams with a losing record, and they’ve beaten up on some of the worst teams in baseball this season. So if you can find a game where the Rays are playing against a weak opponent, that’s a good game to bet on them.

3. Bet on them when they have an advantage in pitching

One of the reasons why the Rays are such a good team is because they have one of the best pitching staffs in baseball. Their pitchers have an ERA of 3.77, which is third best in baseball. So if you can find a game where the Rays have an advantage in pitching, that’s another good game to bet on them.
