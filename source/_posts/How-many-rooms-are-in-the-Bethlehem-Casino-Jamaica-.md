Casinos are a part of the tourist industry that many people love to visit, but what happens when one is built in your backyard? Locals and tourists have been asking this question since Bethlehem Casino Jamaica first came onto the scene in 2015. 

The sleek, modern building sits on a hill overlooking the community of Rio Bueno and the lush green jungle beyond. It's hard to miss, with its towering white façade and bright blue signage. 

What's less obvious is what's going on inside. Rumors have been swirling about the casino since it opened, but few people know for sure what goes on behind those closed doors. Are there games of chance? What about slot machines? How much money changes hands each day?

The casino operates 24 hours a day, seven days a week and averages between 800 and 1,000 visitors each day. On busy days, that number can reach up to 2,000 people. And while James-Lee could not give an estimate of how much money is exchanged each day, she did say that "the casino provides an important contribution to the Jamaican economy." 

So what's the verdict? Is Bethlehem Casino Jamaica worth a visit? 

Yes! The casino is definitely worth a visit whether you're a local or tourist. It offers a fun and exciting experience for everyone and is a great place to socialize and network. Not to mention, it's also great for generating income for the Jamaican economy.

#  How to make the most of your time at Bethlehem Casino Jamaica 

When you visit a casino, one of the most important things to keep in mind is that there is a lot of money at stake. You want to make sure that you make the most of your time and money while you are there. 

One way to do this is to know what games offer the best chances of winning. Blackjack, for example, offers better odds than slots. If you want to improve your chances of winning, then learn how to play blackjack before you head to Bethlehem Casino Jamaica. 

Another thing to keep in mind is that not all games are created equally in terms of payout percentage. Some games offer a higher payout percentage than others. If you are looking to maximise your return on investment, then choose games with a higher payout percentage. 

In addition to playing the right games, you also want to make sure that you are playing with the correct stakes. If you are betting too much, then you could quickly lose all your money. Conversely, if you are betting too little, then you may not see any significant returns on your investment. Find the right balance between these two extremes and you will be able to make the most of your time at Bethlehem Casino Jamaica. 

Finally, remember to have fun! The goal of going to a casino should be enjoyment and relaxation, not stress and anxiety. So take your time, enjoy yourself, and hopefully walk away from Bethlehem Casino Jamaica with more money in your pocket than when you arrived!
