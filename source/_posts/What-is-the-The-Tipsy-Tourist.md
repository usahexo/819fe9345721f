#  What is the The Tipsy Tourist?

The Tipsy Tourist is an online slot game that was introduced by Betsoft in 2014. It is a five-reel and twenty-payline slot game with two bonus rounds and a maximum jackpot of $200,000.

The Tipsy Tourist has a festive theme that is inspired by alcohol and the holidays. The symbols on the reels include drinks like champagne, wine, cocktails, and beer, as well as luggage, travel tickets, sunglasses, and flip flops.

In order to win money while playing The Tipsy Tourist, players need to land matching symbols on adjacent reels starting from the left-most reel. The value of each payout depends on the symbol that is matched and the number of coins that are wagered.

The highest-paying symbol in the game is the champagne bottle. If five of these symbols are matched along an active payline, then the player will win 400 coins. Other high-paying symbols include the wine glass (300 coins), cocktail (250 coins), and beer mug (200 coins). The sunglasses and flip flops are worth 100 coins each, while the luggage is worth 75 coins.

The Tipsy Tourist has two bonus rounds that can be triggered randomly or by landing three or more scatters anywhere on the reels. In the first bonus round, players are given a set of destinations to choose from. Each destination has a different prize amount hidden behind it. Once a destination has been chosen, players must then guess whether or not the tourist will drink from a local vodka bottle or not. If they guess correctly, they will receive their prize amount plus a multiplier that doubles their prize amount. If they guess incorrectly, their prize amount is forfeited.

The second bonus round is called the “Drunken Reels” bonus round. This bonus round is activated when three or more of the scatter symbols appear anywhere on the reels. In this bonus round, players will see four spinning wheels with multiplier values displayed on them. Players can either stop one or all of the wheels to reveal their multiplier values or they can let them all spin automatically for a chance at higher multipliers. After all of the multiplier values have been revealed, all of the active paylines are multiplied by those values to determine the final prize amount.
