#  Precisely What Size LCD Is A Port Machine Frisch?

LCD sizes are available in a range of different sizes. You'll want to purchase the size that is best for your particular needs. For instance, an LCD monitor might be bought by somebody who desires to see pictures and videos clearly from a distance. There are also LCD TVs which might be larger and supply more resolution for users.

Portable machines have become popular in recent times, with many people utilizing them as replacements for their desktop or laptop PCs. One such machine is the MacBook Pro with Retina Display, Apple's high-end notebook. This device features a 13.3-inch LCD screen with a native resolution of 2560x1600 at 227 pixels per inch (ppi). That's quite a dense pixel specification, but how well does it compare to other displays on the market?

To answer that question I've compiled data from both Apple's and PCWorld's website on how various screens rank in terms of ppi. These numbers were taken from laptops and desktops, so if you're looking for an apples-to-apples comparison you'll need to convert the laptop measurements to tablet measurements (Multiply by 1.18). 

* 3840x2160 10" iPad Pro: 265 ppi
* 2732x2048 12.9" iPad Pro: 264 ppi
* 2560x1440 13" MacBook Pro with Retina Display: 227 ppi
* 1920x1080 13" Dell XPS 13: 192 ppi
* 1920x1080 11" HP Spectre x360: 184 ppi
