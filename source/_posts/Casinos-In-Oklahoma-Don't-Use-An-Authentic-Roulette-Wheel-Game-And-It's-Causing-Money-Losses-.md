#  Casinos In Oklahoma Don't Use An Authentic Roulette Wheel Game And It's Causing Money Losses 

Casinos in Colbert and Pushmataha counties are using a roulette wheel game that is not authentic, and it is causing money losses for the casinos.

The roulette wheel game uses 36 numbers, rather than the 38 numbers used in an authentic roulette wheel game. This is causing player confusion and leading to incorrect bets being placed.

The two counties are home to the Choctaw Nation's three casinos: Bok Homa Casino, Pearl River Resort, and Silver Star Casino. The Choctaw Nation operates all three of these casinos.

According to Rusty Evans, the executive director of the Mississippi Band of Choctaw Indians' Gaming Commission, the roulette wheel game in question has been used in other states as well, but it is not an authentic game. Evans said that the game is "notorious for causing player confusion."

In a statement, Neal McCaleb, acting Deputy Chief of the Choctaw Nation said that they are "currently engaged with our gaming regulators and our casino operators to take appropriate corrective action."

It is not clear how long this version of the roulette wheel game has been in use at these casinos or how much money has been lost as a result of it.

#  Casinos In Oklahoma Using Non-Authentic Roulette Wheels Has Been Costing Players Thousands 

In the state of Oklahoma, many casinos have been using non-authentic roulette wheels in order to take advantage of players. This has been costing players thousands of dollars in potential winnings.

There are a few key ways to spot a non-authentic roulette wheel. One is by looking at the pockets on the wheel. Authentic roulette wheels will have 36 pockets, while non-authentic wheels may only have 35 or 34. Additionally, the numbers on a non-authentic wheel may not be in their correct order, or they may be missing entirely.

If you are playing at a casino and see that the roulette wheel appears to be non-authentic, you should ask to speak with a manager. If you have been victimized by this scam, you may be able to get your money back by filing a complaint with the Oklahoma Gambling Control Board.

#  Oklahoma Casinos Could Be Losing Out On Huge Profits By Not Using Authentic Roulette Wheels 

Casinos in Oklahoma are missing out on a major opportunity to increase profits by not using authentic roulette wheels. Roulette is one of the most popular casino games, and players are much more likely to gamble if they feel like they have a chance of winning. Authentic roulette wheels create this feeling of authenticity and can lead to increased profits for casinos.

While there are several companies that make quality roulette wheels, Chicagoland Manufacturing is considered to be the best in the industry. Their wheels are made with the highest quality materials and are precision-engineered to ensure a fair and fun game for players. In addition to their exceptional quality, Chicagoland Manufacturing also offers competitive pricing, making their wheels an excellent value for casinos.

If you’re looking for a way to increase profits at your casino, consider investing in some authentic roulette wheels from Chicagoland Manufacturing. You won’t regret it!

#  Roulette Wheel Game Suppliers Urge Casinos In Oklahoma To Use Genuine Wheels 

Oklahoma's casinos may soon be urged to only use genuine roulette wheels, following the discovery of a number of counterfeit wheels in the state. The Oklahoma Gaming Commission has already sent out a warning to the casinos, and it is thought that the move could come as early as next week.

The commission will reportedly urge the casinos to only use wheels supplied by recognized manufacturers, in an effort to crackdown on the use of counterfeits. It's believed that a significant number of the fake wheels in circulation originate from China, and it's not clear how many have found their way into Oklahoma's casinos.

Officials say that using a counterfeit wheel can potentially impact the outcome of a game, and that players could stand to lose money as a result. In addition, they point out that using genuine wheels is important for protecting the integrity of the game.

The news comes as something of a surprise given that Oklahoma is not generally thought of as a hotbed for gambling activity. However, with revenues from gambling rising rapidly in the state, it's perhaps unsurprising that criminals are targeting this market with counterfeit products.

#  Why Aren't Oklahoma Casinos Using Authentic Roulette Wheels?

Casinos in Oklahoma are missing out on a golden opportunity by not using authentic roulette wheels. This is surprising, given the fact that these casinos are located in a state that is known for its gambling opportunities.

There are several reasons why it is important for casinos to use authentic roulette wheels. For starters, using authentic wheels can help to create a more realistic gaming experience for customers. In addition, using real wheels can also help to increase the odds of winning for players.

Another important consideration for casinos is safety. When roulette wheels are not authentic, there is a greater risk of cheating and scamming. By using real wheels, casinos can help to ensure the safety of their customers and prevent any unfair practices from occurring.

Overall, it is clear that casinos in Oklahoma would benefit from using authentic Roulette wheels. Not only would this create a more realistic gaming experience for customers, but it would also help to improve the odds of winning for players. In addition, using real wheels would help to keep casino operations safe and secure.
