#  Casino's Jelly Boom Game On The Firing Line 

Casino's Jelly Boom game is on the firing line with claims it's a gambling app disguised as a children's game.

The backlash began last week when mother of two, Sara, posted a complaint to the company Facebook page.

"My 4-year-old downloaded this app and I had no idea it was a gambling app until we she asked me to put money in so she could play more," Sara wrote. "This is unacceptable."

The post has since been shared more than 2,000 times, with other parents chiming in to say they also didn't realize the game was a gambling app.

According to The Guardian, the app asks players to spin a wheel in order to win coins which can then be used to play games such as "Jelly Jump" and "Candy crusher". However, if players run out of coins they can purchase more using real money.

In a statement released to The Guardian, Casino said: "Jelly Boom is not a gambling game. It is designed for family fun and entertainment purposes only."

However, many parents aren't convinced. One parent even started a Change.org petition calling for the game's removal from the App Store. The petition has since garnered over 1,200 signatures.

#  Sands Casino's Jelly Boom Game: What Happened To It? 

In 2016, the Sands Casino in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania launched a new game called Jelly Boom. The object of the game was to clear the board by matching three or more pieces of jelly. If you made a mistake and cleared a piece that wasn't supposed to be cleared, it would cause a "jelly explosion" and you would lose points.

The game was an instant hit with casino-goers and quickly became one of the most popular games at the casino. In fact, it was so popular that the casino decided to launch a nationwide advertising campaign for the game.

The only problem was that Jelly Boom was eventually removed from the casino floor. No one seems to know why.

I reached out to the Sands Casino to get their side of the story, but they declined to comment. So I decided to do some digging and try to find out what happened.

The first thing I did was try to find out who created Jelly Boom. I wasn't able to find any information about the game's creator, but I did find out that it was originally created by a company called Merkur Gaming.

Merkur is a German company that specializes in creating casino games. They have created dozens of games over the years, but Jelly Boom is apparently their most successful game ever.

I wasn't able to find any information about why Merkur decided to pull Jelly Boom from casinos worldwide, but I did find this article from CasinoScout24: 


"Merkur Gaming has announced that it is withdrawing its much-loved match-three title Jelly Boom from all land-based casinos with immediate effect."

"Jelly Boom has been performing very well for us since its release in late 2016," says head of product management Stefan Kühnlein."

"However, we received repeated complaints from players who found it too difficult and frustrating when they didn't achieve their targets due simply to chance."

It looks like Merkur pulled the game because players were getting frustrated with not being able to achieve their goals. This makes sense, given that Jelly Boom is a pretty challenging game.

#  Casino To Remove Controversial Jelly Boom Game

The casino has announced that it will be removing the controversial jelly boom game from its floors after receiving complaints from players.

The game, which involves players using jelly beans to shoot at opposing players, has been deemed too violent by some and has been linked with a number of physical confrontations between players.

A statement from the casino read: “We have taken the decision to remove the game after listening to our customers and realizing that it is not in line with our values. We apologize for any inconvenience caused.”
