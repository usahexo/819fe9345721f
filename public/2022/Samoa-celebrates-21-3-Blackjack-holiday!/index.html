This special day commemorates an important moment in Samoan history, when the island nation won its independence from New Zealand in 1962.</p>
<p>3 Blackjack is a popular festival and national holiday in Samoa, celebrated with music, dance, and feasting. The name of the holiday comes from the date – 21 March – which corresponds to 3 Blackjack (or three double-sixes) in poker. This was seen as an auspicious sign for the Samoan people, leading to their victory over New Zealand.</p>
<p>Today, 3 Blackjack is still celebrated as a major event in Samoa, with parades and street parties throughout the country. It’s also a popular time for family reunions, as many people return home to celebrate with their loved ones. Some of the traditional foods eaten during 3 Blackjack include palusami (a dish of pork and onion wrapped in taro leaves), fa’a Samoa (a Samoan feast consisting of grilled meat, coconut cream, and taro), and pua’a (a type of pork sausage).</p>
<p>If you’re lucky enough to be in Samoa on 21 March, be sure to join in the celebrations! There’s no better way to experience traditional Samoan culture than by taking part in this festive national holiday.</p>
<h1 id="Samoan-Prime-Minister-backs-casino-gambling-to-revive-economy"><a href="#Samoan-Prime-Minister-backs-casino-gambling-to-revive-economy" class="headerlink" title="Samoan Prime Minister backs casino gambling to revive economy"></a>Samoan Prime Minister backs casino gambling to revive economy</h1><p>The Prime Minister of Samoa, Tuilaepa Lupesoliai Sailele Malielegaoi, has expressed his support for legalizing casino gambling in a bid to revive the economy. Tuilaepa said that the government was currently considering a number of proposals from investors interested in setting up a casino in the country. He added that he was confident that casino gambling would bring much-needed jobs and revenue to Samoa.</p>
<p>Opponents of casino gambling argue that it can lead to social problems, such as addiction and crime. However, Tuilaepa pointed out that these concerns already exist in Samoa and that the government is better placed to deal with them if a casino is legalized. He also stressed that the revenues generated by a casino could be used to fund social programs, including those aimed at helping addicts.</p>
<p>Tuilaepa’s support for casino gambling comes at a time when the Samoan economy is struggling. The main sources of revenue for Samoa are exports and tourism, but both of these have been hit hard by the global recession. In addition, Samoa has been hit by natural disasters, including earthquakes and a tsunami. As a result, the government is looking for ways to revive the economy and create jobs.</p>
<p>Casino gambling is currently legal in a number of Pacific Islands countries, including Fiji, Guam, Kiribati, and Tonga.</p>

<h1 id="21-3-Blackjack-gaining-popularity-in-Samoa"><a href="#21-3-Blackjack-gaining-popularity-in-Samoa" class="headerlink" title="21 3 Blackjack gaining popularity in Samoa"></a>21 3 Blackjack gaining popularity in Samoa</h1><p>Auckland-based online casino <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.21-3.com/">21 3 Blackjack</a> is gaining popularity in Samoa, with people preferring the game over other variants like poker and roulette.</p>
<p>Gamblers can enjoy the convenience of playing from the comfort of their own homes, with real money payouts available.</p>
<p>John*, who lives in Apia and enjoys gambling, says he prefers 21 3 Blackjack to other games.</p>
<p>“It’s very easy to play – you just need to know how to count cards,” he says.</p>
<p>21 3 Blackjack is a variant of blackjack that uses three decks of cards instead of the usual one. This increases the chances of winning, as there are more cards in play.</p>
<p>The objective of the game is still to get as close to 21 as possible, without going bust (going over 21). Players can bet on their hand against the dealer’s, or opt for a side bet which pays out regardless of the outcome of the main hand.</p>
<p>To stand a chance against the dealer, players need to make informed decisions about when to hit (draw another card), stand (stick with what they have), double down (double their bet and receive one more card), or split (split a hand into two separate hands).</p>
<p>Samoan players can enjoy a range of bonuses when signing up with 21 3 Blackjack, including free spins and no-deposit bonuses. There are also regular promotions available, giving players the chance to win cash prizes and other rewards.</p>
<h1 id="21-3-Blackjack-festival-a-big-hit-in-Samoa"><a href="#21-3-Blackjack-festival-a-big-hit-in-Samoa" class="headerlink" title="21 3 Blackjack festival a big hit in Samoa"></a>21 3 Blackjack festival a big hit in Samoa</h1><p>The third annual Blackjack festival in Samoa is being hailed as a success by organizers. Held at the Taula Resort and Casino, the three-day event featured tournaments, cash prizes, and celebrity appearances.</p>
<p>Blackjack is a popular casino game that is played with cards. The goal is to beat the dealer by getting as close to 21 as possible without going over. In Samoa, blackjack is considered a major sport, and the festival attracts players from all over the world.</p>
<p>This year’s event was sponsored by the Taula Resort and Casino and included a number of tournaments with cash prizes. The top prize was $10,000, which was won by Australian player Ty O’Neill. Other winners included local players Masi Leiua and Savea Ah Chong.</p>
<p>In addition to the tournaments, the festival also featured celebrity appearances by professional blackjack players such as Tommy Dominguez and Darren Elias. Dominguez is one of the most successful blackjack players in the world, having won over $6 million in tournament winnings. Elias is a two-time World Series of Poker champion who has also won several blackjack tournaments.</p>
<p>The festival was well attended by both locals and tourists, and feedback has been overwhelmingly positive. “The Blackjack Festival is one of my favorite events in Samoa,” said one visitor. “The atmosphere is great and the competition is intense.”</p>
<p>“We are very pleased with how the festival went this year,” said Debbie Ah Chong of the Taula Resort and Casino. “The turnout was amazing and everyone had a great time.”</p>
