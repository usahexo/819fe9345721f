            <h1 id="What-is-the-The-Tipsy-Tourist"><a href="#What-is-the-The-Tipsy-Tourist" class="headerlink" title="What is the The Tipsy Tourist?"></a>What is the The Tipsy Tourist?</h1><p>The Tipsy Tourist is an online slot game that was introduced by Betsoft in 2014. It is a five-reel and twenty-payline slot game with two bonus rounds and a maximum jackpot of $200,000.</p>
<p>The Tipsy Tourist has a festive theme that is inspired by alcohol and the holidays. The symbols on the reels include drinks like champagne, wine, cocktails, and beer, as well as luggage, travel tickets, sunglasses, and flip flops.</p>
<p>In order to win money while playing The Tipsy Tourist, players need to land matching symbols on adjacent reels starting from the left-most reel. The value of each payout depends on the symbol that is matched and the number of coins that are wagered.</p>
<p>The highest-paying symbol in the game is the champagne bottle. If five of these symbols are matched along an active payline, then the player will win 400 coins. Other high-paying symbols include the wine glass (300 coins), cocktail (250 coins), and beer mug (200 coins). The sunglasses and flip flops are worth 100 coins each, while the luggage is worth 75 coins.</p>
<p>The Tipsy Tourist has two bonus rounds that can be triggered randomly or by landing three or more scatters anywhere on the reels. In the first bonus round, players are given a set of destinations to choose from. Each destination has a different prize amount hidden behind it. Once a destination has been chosen, players must then guess whether or not the tourist will drink from a local vodka bottle or not. If they guess correctly, they will receive their prize amount plus a multiplier that doubles their prize amount. If they guess incorrectly, their prize amount is forfeited.</p>
<p>The second bonus round is called the “Drunken Reels” bonus round. This bonus round is activated when three or more of the scatter symbols appear anywhere on the reels. In this bonus round, players will see four spinning wheels with multiplier values displayed on them. Players can either stop one or all of the wheels to reveal their multiplier values or they can let them all spin automatically for a chance at higher multipliers. After all of the multiplier values have been revealed, all of the active paylines are multiplied by those values to determine the final prize amount.</p>
<h1 id="What-is-the-The-Tipsy-Tourist-Game"><a href="#What-is-the-The-Tipsy-Tourist-Game" class="headerlink" title="What is the The Tipsy Tourist Game?"></a>What is the The Tipsy Tourist Game?</h1><p>The Tipsy Tourist is a slots game developed and offered by Betsoft Gaming. As the name suggests, the game is set in a party atmosphere, complete with cocktails, lounge music and – of course – a healthy dose of glamour. Players can enjoy this five-reel, 20-payline game on desktop or mobile devices, and there are some great bonus features to help boost their bankrolls.</p>
<p>In terms of aesthetics, The Tipsy Tourist does not disappoint. From the first spin, players will feel like they’ve been invited to a exclusive beachfront party, and the graphics are absolutely superb. Even better, the developers have paid close attention to detail, so players can expect to see realistic animations and sound effects throughout their gaming session.</p>
<p>In terms of gameplay, The Tipsy Tourist is relatively straightforward. Players simply need to select their bet amount (from 0.20 to 100 per spin) and hit the spin button to get started. The reels will then spin and stop on one of several possible outcomes, awarding players prizes based on the symbols that appear on the screen. There are some great prizes up for grabs here, with payouts available for combinations of three or more matching symbols.</p>
<p>However, the real excitement begins when players land one of the game’s bonus symbols. These include a cocktail glass (which awards 10 free spins), a yacht (which awards 20 free spins) and a private jet (which awards 30 free spins). What’s more, all wins during these bonus rounds are doubled – so there’s potential for some serious payouts here!</p>

There is also an autoplay function that allows players to automatically spin the reels for a selected number of spins.</p>
<p>The Tipsy Tourist features a wild symbol that substitutes for all other symbols except the scatter symbol to create winning combinations. The scatter symbol is represented by a champagne bottle and it triggers the free spins bonus round when three or more scatters appear anywhere on the reels. During the free spins bonus round, all wins are tripled.</p>
