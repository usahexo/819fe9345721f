            <h1 id="Bingo-Halls-Reopen-in-California-After-Statewide-Lockdown-Lifted"><a href="#Bingo-Halls-Reopen-in-California-After-Statewide-Lockdown-Lifted" class="headerlink" title="Bingo Halls Reopen in California After Statewide Lockdown Lifted"></a>Bingo Halls Reopen in California After Statewide Lockdown Lifted</h1><p>Following the statewide lockdown being lifted, bingo halls are reopening up in California. The lockdown was implemented at the beginning of March in order to help contain the spread of COVID-19.</p>
<p>Bingo had been one of the few forms of entertainment available to people during the lockdown, and as a result, attendance at bingo halls had surged. Now that people are allowed to leave their homes again, bingo hall operators are expecting a drop in attendance.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, many bingo hall operators are optimistic about the future and are planning to continue offering bingo games even after the COVID-19 pandemic has passed. “We’re just happy to be open again and provide some form of normalcy for people during these crazy times,” said one operator.</p>
<h1 id="Bingo-Halls-to-Remain-Closed-in-California-Amidst-Ongoing-COVID-19-Pandemic"><a href="#Bingo-Halls-to-Remain-Closed-in-California-Amidst-Ongoing-COVID-19-Pandemic" class="headerlink" title="Bingo Halls to Remain Closed in California Amidst Ongoing COVID-19 Pandemic"></a>Bingo Halls to Remain Closed in California Amidst Ongoing COVID-19 Pandemic</h1><p>Governor Gavin Newsom of California has ordered all bingo halls in the state to remain closed amid the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. This announcement follows similar orders issued for other public venues, including bars, restaurants, and theaters.</p>
<p>“This is a difficult decision, but it is necessary to help protect the health and safety of Californians,” said Governor Newsom in a statement. “I appreciate the hard work of our small business owners and employees, and I know this will be frustrating for them. But we must all do our part to stop the spread of this virus.”</p>
<p>Many bingo hall owners and workers are disappointed by the order. “We’re just trying to make a living,” said one owner. “The government is putting us out of business.”</p>
<p>Others expressed hope that things will improve soon. “I understand why they’re doing this,” said one worker. “But it’s still hard to take.”</p>
<p>Governor Newsom’s order follows similar ones issued by governors in other states. Many experts believe that such measures are necessary to help prevent the spread of COVID-19.</p>
<h1 id="Some-Bingo-Halls-in-California-Begin-to-Reopen-but-others-remain-closed"><a href="#Some-Bingo-Halls-in-California-Begin-to-Reopen-but-others-remain-closed" class="headerlink" title="Some Bingo Halls in California Begin to Reopen, but others remain closed"></a>Some Bingo Halls in California Begin to Reopen, but others remain closed</h1><p>Some bingo halls in California have reopened in recent weeks, but many others remain closed due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Included among the reopened halls are those in Dinuba, Fowler, and Selma.</p>
<p>The reopening of these bingo halls is seen as a positive sign by some in the community, as it provides an opportunity for socializing and networking. However, other members of the community are concerned that the reopenings may not be enough to prevent the spread of COVID-19.</p>
<p>It is still unclear when or if all bingo halls in California will reopen. Some organizations are calling for statewide closures in order to help mitigate the spread of the virus, while others are advocating for a more case-by-case approach.</p>
<h1 id="California-Governor-Announces-Reopening-of-All-Bingo-Halls"><a href="#California-Governor-Announces-Reopening-of-All-Bingo-Halls" class="headerlink" title="California Governor Announces Reopening of All Bingo Halls"></a>California Governor Announces Reopening of All Bingo Halls</h1><p>Governor Gavin Newsom of California announced on Wednesday the reopening of all bingo halls in the state.</p>
<p>“This is great news for our seniors and for our economy,” Governor Newsom said. “The reopening of these halls will create jobs and bring much-needed revenue to local communities.”</p>
<p>Bingo has been a popular pastime for seniors for many years, and the reopening of bingo halls will give them a much-needed place to gather and socialize. In addition, the halls will generate income for local businesses and governments.</p>
<p>Governor Newsom thanked the Legislature for its support in this initiative. “I’m proud of what we’ve been able to achieve together,” he said. “This is another example of how we’re working hard to improve the quality of life for all Californians.”</p>
<h1 id="San-Francisco-Bay-Area-Bingo-Halls-among-First-to-Reopen-in-California"><a href="#San-Francisco-Bay-Area-Bingo-Halls-among-First-to-Reopen-in-California" class="headerlink" title="San Francisco Bay Area Bingo Halls among First to Reopen in California"></a>San Francisco Bay Area Bingo Halls among First to Reopen in California</h1><p>With the statewide smoking ban now in effect, bingo halls in California’s San Francisco Bay Area are among the first to reopen their doors to smokers.</p>
<p>The ban, which took effect on Monday, outlaws smoking in all workplaces and public places, including bars, restaurants and bingo halls.</p>
<p>However, exemptions have been made for tobacco shops and certain other businesses that sell tobacco products.</p>
<p>Bingo hall owners in the Bay Area say they are happy to be able to welcome smokers back into their establishments.</p>
<p>“We’re really excited that we can let our smokers play bingo again,” said Darren Lee, manager of the Lucky Dog Bingo Hall in Fremont. “They’ve been missing out on a lot since the ban went into effect.”</p>
<p>Lee says that since the smoking ban went into effect, business at the Lucky Dog Bingo Hall has been way down.</p>
<p>“Smokers used to make up about 50 percent of our customer base,” he said. “Now it’s more like 25 percent.”</p>
<p>Lee says that he is not sure whether the exemption for bingo halls will be enough to bring business back up to where it was before the ban, but he is hopeful.</p>
<p>“I think it will help some,” he said. “But it’s not going to bring it all back.”</p>
