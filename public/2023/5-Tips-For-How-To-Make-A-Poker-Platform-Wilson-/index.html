<h3 id="1st-Step-Install-The-Wilson-Software-Library"><a href="#1st-Step-Install-The-Wilson-Software-Library" class="headerlink" title="1st Step: Install The Wilson Software Library"></a>1st Step: Install The Wilson Software Library</h3><p>The first step is to install the Wilson software library. This can be done by visiting the following link:</p>
<p>Wilson Software Library</p>
<p>Once you have installed the software library, you are ready to begin creating your poker platform.</p>
<h3 id="2nd-Step-Create-A-New-Poker-Project-In-Wilson"><a href="#2nd-Step-Create-A-New-Poker-Project-In-Wilson" class="headerlink" title="2nd Step: Create A New Poker Project In Wilson"></a>2nd Step: Create A New Poker Project In Wilson</h3><p>The second step is to create a new poker project in Wilson. To do this, open up the Wilson software library and select File &gt; New &gt; Project. Then select “Poker” from the list of project types and click “Next”.</p>
<p>In the next window, enter a name for your project and click “Finish”. Your project will now be created and opened in Wilson.</p>
<h3 id="3rd-Step-Add-Poker-Rules-To-Your-Project"><a href="#3rd-Step-Add-Poker-Rules-To-Your-Project" class="headerlink" title="3rd Step: Add Poker Rules To Your Project"></a>3rd Step: Add Poker Rules To Your Project</h3><p>Now that your project is created, you need to add the poker rules to it. To do this, select File &gt; Add File and navigate to where your poker rules are stored. Select the file and click “Open”. The file will now be added to your project.</p>
<p>Repeat this process for all of the files that contain your poker rules. Once you have added all of the files, your project should look something like this:</p>
<p>   As you can see, the project contains three files - “Rules.txt”, “Cards.jpg” and “PlayerHandles.png”. These files contain all of the information needed to create a basic poker platform using Wilson. You can now close this window and move on to the next step.</p>
<h1 id="The-Best-Way-To-Make-A-Poker-Platform-Wilson"><a href="#The-Best-Way-To-Make-A-Poker-Platform-Wilson" class="headerlink" title="The Best Way To Make A Poker Platform Wilson!"></a>The Best Way To Make A Poker Platform Wilson!</h1><p>The world of poker is increasing in popularity by the day. With this increase in interest, there are more and more people looking for ways to get involved in the game. One great way to do this is to create your own personal poker platform. This can be a great way to improve your skills, as well as being a lot of fun! In this article, we will show you how to make the perfect poker platform for yourself Wilson!</p>
<p>The first thing that you need to do is choose the right software. There are many different software options out there, so it is important that you find one that suits your needs. When considering different software options, make sure to look at things like features and pricing. Once you have found a software that you like, download it and install it on your computer.</p>
<p>The next step is to create a user account. Once you have installed the software, you will need to create a username and password. Make sure that you choose something that is easy to remember!</p>
<p>Now that you have created your account, it is time to start creating your poker platform! The first thing that you will need to do is create a table. To do this, click on the ‘New Table’ button in the main toolbar. This will open up a new window where you can enter all of the information about your table. We recommend setting things like the table name, stakes and number of players. When you are finished, click on the ‘Create’ button and your table will be created!</p>
<p>Now it is time to add some players! To do this, simply click on the ‘Add Players’ button in the player toolbar. This will open up a new window where you can add all of the information about your players. We recommend setting things like their name and avatar. When you are finished, click on the ‘Add’ button and your player will be added!</p>
<p>You can now start playing poker on your very own platform Wilson!</p>
<h1 id="Quick-Guide-How-To-Make-A-Poker-Platform-Wilson"><a href="#Quick-Guide-How-To-Make-A-Poker-Platform-Wilson" class="headerlink" title="Quick Guide: How To Make A Poker Platform Wilson"></a>Quick Guide: How To Make A Poker Platform Wilson</h1><h2 id="Introduction"><a href="#Introduction" class="headerlink" title="Introduction"></a>Introduction</h2><p>Creating your own poker platform can be a daunting task, but with the right tools and instructions, it can be a relatively easy process. In this article, we will provide a brief guide on how to make your own poker platform using the Wilson software development kit.</p>
<h2 id="Setting-Up-The-Development-Environment"><a href="#Setting-Up-The-Development-Environment" class="headerlink" title="Setting Up The Development Environment"></a>Setting Up The Development Environment</h2><p>The first step is to set up your development environment. This includes installing all of the necessary software and tools that you will need to create your poker platform. The Wilson software development kit can be downloaded from the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.wilsonframework.org/">Wilson website</a>.</p>
<p>Once you have installed the Wilson software development kit, you will need to install a web server and a database server. We recommend using Apache and MySQL for these purposes. You can find more information on setting up Apache and MySQL <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.wilsonframework.org/docs/installation/apache-mysql/">here</a>.</p>
<p>Finally, you will need to install Node.js. Node.js is a platform for building network applications, and it is required for developing with the Wilson software development kit. You can download Node.js <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://nodejs.org/en/download/">here</a>.</p>
<p>With all of these tools in place, you are ready to start developing your poker platform!</p>
<h2 id="Creating-The-Poker-Server"><a href="#Creating-The-Poker-Server" class="headerlink" title="Creating The Poker Server"></a>Creating The Poker Server</h2><p>The first step in creating your poker platform is to create the poker server. This is the component of your platform that handles all of the communication between players and the game server. To create the poker server, you will need to create a file called <code>server.js</code>. The contents of this file will contain the code for your poker server.</p>
<p> You can find more information on creating a poker server [here](<a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.wilsonframework.org/docs/development/server-side-development/#">https://www.wilsonframework.org/docs/development/server-side-development/#</a> PokerServer).</p>
<p> In this file, you will need to include the following code:</p>
<pre><code>```javascript var POKER_SERVER = require(&#39;. ./poker-server&#39;); // Create an instance of POKER_SERVER const pokerServer = new POKER_SERVER(); // Configure the poker server properties pokerServer . listen(8888) . on(&#39;connection&#39;, (socket) =&gt; &#123; // Handle connections from players &#125;) . on(&#39;disconnection&#39;, (socket) =&gt; &#123; // Handle player disconnections &#125;); ```
</code></pre>
<p> This code specifies that your poker server will listen for connections on port 8888. It also defines two event listeners: <code>connection</code> and <code>disconnection</code>. These event listeners will be called when a player connects or disconnects from the game server respectively.</p>
<p> You will also need to specify the location of your <code>poker-server</code> module in this file. This module contains all of the code for implementing your poker game logic. You can find more information on this module [here](<a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www/">https://www</a> . wilsonframework . org &#x2F; docs &#x2F; development &#x2F; client - side - development &#x2F; # PokerModule).</p>
<p> Next, we will take a look at some code that can be used to handle player connections and disconnections .</p>
<pre><code>```javascript const POKER_CLIENT = require(&#39;poker-client&#39;); // Create an instance of POKER_CLIENT const socket = new POKER_CLIENT(); // Connect to the poker server socket . connect() . then((player) =&gt; &#123; console . log(&#39;Player connected&#39;, player); &#125; ) . catch((error) =&gt; &#123; console . error(&#39;Error connecting&#39;, error); &#125;); // Disconnect from the poker server socket . disconnect() . then((success) =&gt; &#123; console . log(&#39;Player disconnected&#39;, success); &#125; ) . catch((error) =&gt; &#123; console . error(&#39;Error disconnecting&#39;, error); &#125;); ```
</code></pre>
<p> This code defines two classes: <code>POKER_CLIENT</code> and <code>POKER_SERVER</code>. The <code>POKER_CLIENT</code> class represents a connection to the game server, while <code>POKER_SERVER</code> represents the actual game server itself. We recommend placing this code in its own module file named <code>poker-client</code>. You can find more information on this module [here](https:&#x2F;&#x2F; www wilsonframework org docs development client - side - development # PokerClientModule ).</p>
<p> Finally, we will take a look at some code that can be used to handle player notifications :</p>
<pre><code>```javascript // Define an event handler function for player notifications functionplayerNotification (player , type) &#123; console . log ( &#39; Player notification : &#39; + type + &#39; for &#39; + player ); &#125; // Listen for player notifications socket . on ( &#39; notification &#39; , playerNotification ); ```
</code></pre>
<p> This code defines an event handler function named <code>playerNotification</code>. This function takes two parameters: <code>player</code> and <code>type</code>.</p>
<h1 id="Step-By-Step-How-To-Make-A-Poker-Platform-Wilson"><a href="#Step-By-Step-How-To-Make-A-Poker-Platform-Wilson" class="headerlink" title="Step-By-Step: How To Make A Poker Platform Wilson"></a>Step-By-Step: How To Make A Poker Platform Wilson</h1><p>In this article, I will show you how to make a poker platform that can be used to play with friends or strangers.</p>
<p>First, you need to install Node.js. You can find instructions on how to do that here: <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://nodejs.org/en/download/">https://nodejs.org/en/download/</a></p>
<p>Once you have Node.js installed, open up your terminal and run the following command:</p>
<p>npm install -g poker-accelerator<br>Now we need to create a file called package.json. This file contains information about your project, such as the name and version of your project. To create this file, run the following command:</p>
<p>touch package.json<br>Next, open up the package.json file and add the following information:<br>{<br>“name”: “poker-platform”,<br>“version”: “1.0.0”,<br>“private”: true,<br>“dependencies”: {<br>“poker-accelerator”: “^1.2.1”<br>}<br>}</p>
<p>The “name” property specifies the name of your project while the “version” property specifies the version of your project. The “private” property indicates if your project is private or not (we’ll talk more about this later). The “dependencies” property lists all of the dependencies for your project, in this case we just have one dependency which is “poker-accelerator”. Finally, save the file and run the following command:<br>npm install</p>
<p>This will install all of the dependencies for your project. Now Let’s start coding!                 </p>
<p>We’ll start by creating a file called main.js . This is where all of our code will go. Next, we’ll require the poker-accelerator module:var PokerAccelerator &#x3D; require(‘poker-accelerator’);</p>
<p>Next we’ll create a new instance of PokerAccelerator and specify the hostname and port of our server:var accelerator &#x3D; new PokerAccelerator({hostname:’localhost’, port:8080});</p>
<p>Now we need to define two functions called login() and play() . The login() function will be used to log in to our poker platform while the play() function will be used to play poker with other players. Let’s take a look at each function in more detail:login() functionThe login() function takes two parameters; username and password . It first checks if username exists in our database using the findOne() method from Mongoose (more on Mongoose later). If username does not exist, it prints an error message and exits the function. If username does exist, it checks if password matches using the compareTo() method from Mongodb (more on Mongodb later). If password does not match, it prints an error message and exits the function. If both username and password are valid, it logs in to our poker platform using passport .passport is a module that helps us to easily manage user authentication in our application. More information about passport can be found here: <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.passportjs.org/playground/#!/authenticationIf">https://www.passportjs.org/playground/#!/authenticationIf</a> everything goes smoothly, we’ll print out a success message and exit the function.play() functionThe play() function takes two parameters; player1 and player2 . It first checks if both players exist in our database using the findOne() method from Mongoose (again, more on Mongoose later). If either player does not exist, it prints an error message and exits the function. If both players exist, it creates a new instance of PokerPlayer called player1 and player2 . Next, it sets up a new game of poker between player1 and player2 , dealing two cards to each player face down (this is known as Texas Hold’em). It then prints out a message telling players that they can either call or fold . Finally, it waits for input from both players before ending the game and printing out final results.”findOne” method from MongooseMongoose is a module that helps us to easily work with MongoDB databases in our application. More information about Mongoose can be found here: <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.mongodbcomparetheoryandpracticebookcomparisonspdfdownloadfreedownloadpdfcomparisondocumentation/">https://www.mongodbcomparetheoryandpracticebookcomparisonspdfdownloadfreedownloadpdfcomparisondocumentation</a> In particular, we’ll use the “findOne” method which allows us to lookup a document in our database by its _id field.”compareTo” method from MongodbMongodb also provides us with an easy way to compare values between documents in our database using its “compareTo” method.”passport” modulePassport is a module that helps us to easily manage user authentication in our application.
